## Secondary Test Path
- Register successfully
- Create new listing successfully
- Logout
- Register as new user
- Enter an unmatching phrase into the search bar
- Confirm we can't see our listing
#### Aim
- To show that the basic search functions work.
- A user will have to search and sort through listings when performing their aim, which is to find a suitable listing to book. Hence confirming a path through the landing page with an available listing is useful.
#### P.S.
- Originally we wanted to create multiple listings with different publish dates, prices and bedrooms, to use all of the search filters (date, price, beds ranges) but didn't finish.
